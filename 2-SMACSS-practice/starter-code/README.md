##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I was following the guidelines from the reading, more specifically this https://smacss.com/.
Also in a nutshell, stuff that is general and affects the big picture go into the base, individual elements with id's and the like go into the modules, and the rest into the layout.

I did not, it was pretty as is
